# Machine Health Monitoring Jupyter Notebook Project

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on monitoring the health of machines using various machine learning techniques. The project aims to analyze sensor data from machines, detect anomalies, and provide insights into the overall health of the machines.

## Features

- **Data Exploration:** Explore and visualize the sensor data to gain insights into the machine's behavior and patterns.

- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess the data to ensure it is suitable for machine learning model training.

- **Machine Learning Models:** Implement and train machine learning models for anomaly detection, predicting machine failures, and assessing overall health.

- **Visualizations:** Generate informative visualizations to help interpret and understand the results of the machine learning models.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/machine-health-monitoring.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd machine-health-monitoring
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

5. Open the `Machine_Health_Monitoring.ipynb` notebook and run each cell sequentially.

## Data

The dataset used for this project can be found in the `data` directory. Make sure to explore and understand the dataset before proceeding with the notebook.

## Usage
